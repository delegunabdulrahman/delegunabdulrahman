What is Git?
Git is a Version Control System that records the changes made to our code everytime in a special database called Repository

The use of Repository:
1) It can be used to check our project history and see who has made changes when and why

2) It can be used to revert our project back to earlier stage

Version Control System can be used in the following:
1) Track Project History
2) Work Together
Version Control System fall into two Categories:
1) Centralized System : All Team members connect to a server to get the code work but if the Server goes offline or fails, The Team members would not be able to
collaborate with each other because they don'thave the copy of the project locally, until the server come online again which is a quite problem for the Team members.

Examples:
1) Subversion
2) Team Fondation Server
2) Distributed System : Every Team members have the copy of the project with its history locally on their machines  in case of if the Server goes offline or fails,
and this is quite easy for the Team members because they can still access the files even though the server is offline.

Examples:
1) Git
2) Mercurial

Advantages of Git:
1) Free
2) Open Source
3) Super Fast
4) Scalable
5) Cheap Branding / Merging
